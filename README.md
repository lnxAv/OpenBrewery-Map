# Submission Notes

## Objective

<details>
<summary>Project A</summary>
The client wants to create a web app that allows users to browse and view breweries. They have proposed using [this API](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/).
</details>
My goal was to give the user a single place to search and see the locations of various breweries in the united states

## The Challenges

I wanted to challenge myself from the start,
Thus considering I had never explored any map API or map libraries before,
I set myself on a short course to know more about them.

## The approach

My first step was to find the best tools and know more about the Open Brewery DB,
I have decided to settle with SWR as a good middleware to handle the API,
Has for the map I settled with [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) and [react-leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/),
This decision was made because the MapBox API (v1) and Google Map Javascript were unnecessarily complicated and didn't offer the level of freedom I was looking for, 
the one downside to note however is that leaflet is not SSR-able,
Once those two were chosen I settled for [Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com/showcase) since I like the rapidity and already owned some snippets,

Finally, I drew a hierarchy of how I wanted things to work, thus with some quick pseudo-code I stayed true to it.
